This trend is of great concern to scientists and policymakers, as it has significant implications for our planet's ecosystems, human health, and the global economy. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the earth's average surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1\\u00B0C (2\\u00B0F) since pre-industrial times, and this trend is expected to continue without urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of factors that contribute to the earth's rising temperature, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of negative impacts. One of the most significant effects of rising temperatures is the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, which contributes to sea level rise and puts coastal communities at risk of flooding and other disasters. In addition, warming temperatures can lead to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires, which can have devastating impacts on human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. The rise in temperature also affects the delicate balance of ecosystems, causing shifts in species' habitats and life cycles, and leading to increased extinction rates. This in turn has implications for the global food supply, as many crops and livestock depend on specific environmental conditions to thrive. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of policy changes, technological innovations, and individual actions. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in the fight against climate change, and it is up to all of us to take action to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. \");\n      i0.ɵɵelementEnd()()();\n    }\n  },\n  styles: [\".container[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{\\r\\npadding-top: 100px;\\r\\n\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh1[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{\\r\\n    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\\r\\n    color: lighten(#FF512F, 10%);\\r\\n    padding: 40px;\\r\\n    margin: 0 0 50px;\\r\\n    font-size: 30px;\\r\\n    text-transform: uppercase;\\r\\n    font-weight: 700;\\r\\n    text-align: center;\\r\\n\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  \\r\\nimg[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{\\r\\n    width: 400px;\\r\\n    display: block;\\r\\n  margin-left: auto;\\r\\n  margin-right: auto;\\r\\n  width: 50%;\\r\\n}\\r\\n.para[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{\\r\\n   \\r\\n}\\n/*# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,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 */\"]\n});","map":{"version":3,"mappings":";AAOA,OAAM,MAAOA,oBAAoB;AAApBA,oBAAoB;mBAApBA,oBAAoB;AAAA;AAApBA,oBAAoB;QAApBA,oBAAoB;EAAAC;EAAAC;EAAAC;EAAAC;EAAAC;IAAA;MCNjCC,0BAAI;MAACA,uBAAM;MAAAA,iBAAK;MAChBA,8BAAuB;MAEvBA,yBAAyC;MACrCA,iBAAM;MACVA,8BAAkB;MAEdA,iiEAWJ;MAAAA,iBAAI","names":["PredictionsComponent","selectors","decls","vars","consts","template","i0"],"sourceRoot":"","sources":["C:\\Users\\harsh\\Desktop\\Bridge Batch\\Angular\\HelpEarth\\src\\app\\predictions\\predictions.component.ts","C:\\Users\\harsh\\Desktop\\Bridge Batch\\Angular\\HelpEarth\\src\\app\\predictions\\predictions.component.html"],"sourcesContent":["import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-predictions',\n  templateUrl: './predictions.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./predictions.component.css']\n})\nexport class PredictionsComponent {\n\n}\n","\n<h1> FUTURE</h1>\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n<img src=\"assets/predictions.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n    </div>\n<div class=\"para\">\n<p>\n    The earth's temperature has been increasing steadily over the past century, with the rate of warming accelerating in recent decades.
